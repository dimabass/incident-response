Q -24 : What is the name of the directory where information about JumpList items (automatically generated by the system) is stored?
**Answer: AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations**

To retrieve **Automatic Destinations**, I perform a quick search online, which provides the necessary information. I also review the *CustomDestinations*, which will be useful later.

I navigate to the **CustomDestinations** directory and extract the relevant Jump List mentioned in the task.
